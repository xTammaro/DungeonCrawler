# Welcome to DungeonCrawler

This is a basic 2D dungeon game that I and a few friends developed during 2023 while at ANU. It achieved HD in COMP2310 (Software Engineering) and was developed over the course of 5 weeks. If you would like to try it for yourself head over to the initlization section of the wiki. Otherwise, there is a demo video which showcases the game.

The wiki has a lot of useful information for how it was designed and implemented, if you are interested.
